Every X number of milliseconds the nodejs server pulls from the redis server.
Upon pulling from the redis server if the message is the same as the last pulled message,
then the staleness for that particular message type increments.

If the message of the nodejs server is different than the message it was last time then
the staleness resets to its leniency value.

The message will only be reported as stale to the client sif the staleness reaches a value above the zero.
